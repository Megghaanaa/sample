    Sharma engages in numerous philanthropic activities, promoting various causes such as animal welfare, health, and
    children.[96] He is particularly vocal about the protection of animals and has supported various initiatives and
    organisations to promote the cause.[97]

    In February 2015, Sharma joined People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to support sterilisation of
    homeless cats and dogs. When supporting the cause Sharma said, "Sterilisation is important because I feel that if we
    can stop (the homeless-animal crisis), there will be control of population among the street dogs".[98]

    In September 2015, along with Hollywood actors Matt LeBlanc and Salma Hayek, Sharma joined an anti-poaching campaign
    in Kenya to save the wild animals of Africa including the last surviving northern white rhinoceros. When joining the
    campaign Sharma said, "I have been a member of PETA and when I was informed about the cause, I thought it is my duty
    to join the anti-poaching drive. That's what got me to Nairobi. I was fascinated to have a look at Sudan (the last
    northern white rhino) and the sniffer dogs who catch hold of the poachers
