    Rahman is involved with a number of charitable causes. In 2004 he was appointed as the global ambassador of the Stop
    TB Partnership, a WHO project.[99] Rahman has supported Save the Children India and worked with Yusuf Islam on
    "Indian Ocean", a song featuring a-ha keyboard player Magne Furuholmen and Travis drummer Neil Primrose. Proceeds
    from the song went to help orphans in Banda Aceh who were affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.[158] He
    produced the single "We Can Make It Better" by Don Asian with Mukhtar Sahota.[159] In 2008 Rahman opened the KM
    Music Conservatory with an audio-media education facility to train aspiring musicians in vocals, instruments, music
    technology and sound design. The conservatory (with prominent musicians on staff and a symphony orchestra) is
    located near his studio in Kodambakkam, Chennai and offers courses at several levels. Violinist L. Subramaniam is on
    its advisory board.[160] Several of Rahman's proteges from the studio have scored feature films.[161] In 2009, he
    founded Sunshine Orchestra with a vision to introduce India's first symphony orchestra where economically and
    socially deprived children get free music education by the KM Music Conservatory. He composed the theme music for a
    2006 short film for The Banyan to aid poor women in Chennai.
