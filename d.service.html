        MS Dhoni established his MS Dhoni Charity Foundation in 2010 and collaborated with many NGOs for serving
        different causes.
        As per an article on Yourstory, MS Dhoni is among the top charitable cricketers of India. The list also has
        Kapil Dev, Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar.
        No one can forget his 2 crore donation to CRPF
        He coordinates with Virat Kohli’s charity foundation VKF to serve the needy people.
        With the Rhiti Foundation, MS Dhoni also works for a noble charity cause for uplifting young athletes.
        Truly MS Dhoni really has a heart of gold, so if you’re trolling him for his donations for coronavirus, you’re
        out of context. You never knew how much he had donated so far.
