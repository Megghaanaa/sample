            <h3>
                <p> Kohli is an Indian
                    cricketer who is the current captain of the India national team. He plays for Delhi in domestic
                    cricket
                    and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as the right-handed batsman. He
                    is
                    widely considered one of the world's best batsmen.[2]

                    Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. A few months
                    later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having played
                    as a
                    reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular middle-order batsman in
                    the
                    ODI and was part of the squad that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011
                    and
                    shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South
                    Africa.[3]
                    Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time in
                    2013,[4]
                    Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC
                    World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).</p>

                <p>
                    Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy
                    following MS Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs captain
                    after
                    Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the second-highest number of centuries and
                    the
                    highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. He holds the world record for being the
                    fastest
                    batsman to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000 and 12,000 runs in ODI cricket. He also holds the world
                    record
                    of being the fastest to 23,000 international runs.

            <h3>In March 2013, Kohli started a charity foundation called Virat Kohli Foundation (VKF). The organisation
                aims at helping underprivileged kids and conducts events to raise funds for the charity.[469] According
                to Kohli, the foundation works with select NGOs to "create awareness, seek support and raise funds for
                the various causes they endorse and the philanthropic work they engage in."[470] In May 2014, eBay and
                Save the Children India conducted a charity auction with VKF, with its proceeds benefiting the education
                and healthcare of underprivileged children.[471]
