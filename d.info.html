        Mahendra Singh Dhoni (About this soundpronunciation (help·info) born 7 July 1981), is a former Indian
        international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in
        Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. MS Dhoni is the only captain in the history of cricket to win all ICC
        trophies.[2] Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups,
        the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed middle-order batsman and
        wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000
        runs scored and is considered an effective 'finisher' in limited-overs formats.[3][4][5] He was also the first
        wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket.[6] Dhoni’s skill in the cricket field has been praised by
        cricketers such as Kapil Dev, Adam Gilchrist, Nasser Hussain and Kevin Peterson who have often ranked him is as
        one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen and captains in the history of the game
